# !!! note
#     This example corresponds to the simulations in Shi, P., Wei, M., & Barbot, S. (2022), JGR - Solid Earth - 10.1029/2022jb024069. 
#     The mesh size is reduced to improve CI/CD speed and avoid timeouts.

# # Problem statement
# We would like to investigate the stress interaction between a 2D plane transform fault and a 3D mantle 
# and how it affects the seismic pattern.

# !!! tip
#     You will need to install [SpecialFunctions](https://github.com/JuliaMath/SpecialFunctions.jl) and [Optim](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl) to run this example. We use them to help set up the initial conditions for the equations.

# # Generate the meshes

# Generate the mesh for the transform fault, which is suitable for using the Okada (1992) equation.
# The fault is 80 km long, 8 km deep, with grid sizes of 10 km and 2 km respectively, and a dip angle of 90 degrees (vertical).
mf = gen_mesh(Val(:RectOkada), 80e3, 8e3, 10e3, 2e3, 90.0);

# The mesh `mf` is a `RectOkadaMesh`, which contains the fault geometry, centroid coordinates, and other properties.

# Use Gmsh to generate the mantle mesh, which is suitable for using the Barbot et al. (2017) equation.
# The volume is 80 km long, 5 km wide, and 14 km deep, with a grid size of 4 cells along the **x** direction, 3 cells along the **y** direction, and 3 cells along the **z** direction.
# There is no refinement in the **x** or **y** direction, while cell sizes are 1.5 times progressively larger along the **z** axis.

@time gf‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ = stress_greens_function(ma, Œª, Œº; qtype = "Gauss1")
h5write(gffile, "gf‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ", gf‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ); # mantle -> mantle

# !!! tip
#     The `buffer_ratio` denotes the fraction of the original fault length
#     on the two sides of the fault in which no dislocation occurs.
#     It serves as a buffer zone to imitate the ridge section on the edges of an oceanic transform fault (personal communication with Yajing Liu).
#     Basically, it affects how the stiffness tensor is periodically summed.

# !!! tip
#     Notice that, in Gmsh before v4.9, the quadrature type "Gauss2" does not stand for the product rule; instead, it is an optimized cubature
#     rule (see [this issue](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/issues/1351)). For more cubature rules, see [quadpy](https://github.com/nschloe/quadpy).

# !!! tip
#     It is recommended to use at least `Gauss2` quadrature for the mantle mesh to ensure the maximum real part of the eigenvalues of the stiffness tensor is small.
#     The volumetric mean has drastically reduced it to avoid numerical instability. See the appendix of the [Shi et al., 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JB024069) for more details.

# !!! tip
#     See [this issue](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl/issues/785) to learn more about retrieving derivatives in the solution.

# !!! tip
#     We often find that multi-step solvers like `VCABM5` are more efficient than single-step solvers like `Tsit5` for this kind of problem.

# # Analyze the results

# The solution is saved in the `output.h5` file, which contains the time series of velocity, state variable, strain rate, strain, stress, and slip.
# We can load the solution and analyze the results, for example, extracting the earthquake catalog from the velocity time series, visualizing the fault rupture, mantle strain flow, etc.
# Readers are encouraged to explore the figures in the [Shi et al., 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JB024069) for more insights.

# !!! tip
#     To generate the PVD files for visualization in Paraview, we can use the following functions. 
#     The output PVD file can be opened in Paraview to visualize the animation of the fault and mantle evolution.
#     It includes the velocity and state variable on the fault and strain rate in the mantle, for all the time steps.
